did this through the following steps:

converted an existing Parquet-based data lake table to a Delta table, health_tracker_silver.

performed a batch upload of new data to this table.

used Spark SQL to identify broken and missing records in this table.

used Delta Lake’s ability to do an upsert, where we updated broken records and inserted missing records.

used Delta Lake’s Time Travel feature to scrub the personal data of a user intelligently.

Additionally, we used Delta Lake to create an aggregate table, health_tracker_user_analytics, downstream from the health_tracker_silver table.

Created Gold tables for different Marts as per different requirements.
